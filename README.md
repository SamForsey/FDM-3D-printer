DIY FDM 3d Printer

Based on a cast iron surface plate. 18x18", weight approx 30kg.

The requirements; 

- print the greatest quality and performance engineering materials, such as Polycarbonate, Nylon, ABS.
- print at up to 20m/s^2 acceleration
- mechanically fixed bed level

These requirements dictate that the surface plate be able to heat up to approx. 140C, 
an insulated enclosure with temperature control up to 100C and all components must be able to withstand those temperatures.

Mechanically fixed bed level is why the cast iron surface plate was chosen as the basis for the printer. This heavy base with dimensional 
stability should mean that once the gantry is levelled it should not require relevelling.
