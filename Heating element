How much power does the heating element require to heat the surface plate up to 140C in 30minutes.

All values/equations from https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/specific-heat-metals-d_152.html

Specific heat capacity Cast Iron	0.46kj/(kgK)

q = cp m dt                                           (1)

where

q = heat required (kJ)
cp = specific heat (kJ/kg K, kJ/kg C°) = 0.46
dt = temperature difference (K, C°) = 140C
m = mass of object = 30kg


P = Work / time

P = power (W, ft lb/s)
W = work done (J, ft lb)
dt = time taken (s)

q = 0.46x30x140 = 1932kJ  or 1,932,000J
time taken = 30minutes or 1800s

Power = 1932000/1800 = 1075watts to heat

Assuming 50% energy loss to the environment, a 2200watt heating element is required.
